# Usage

 1. After downloading, open the file with your editor of choice.
 2. Next, copy the entire code from the file to your clipboard.
 3. After this, open the Developer Tools Console in your browser on the same page that the file you are trying to download is in.
 4. Finally, paste the copied code inside the console and run it.
 5. The script will start to go through all the pages of the document until it reaches the last, at which point you will be asked to name the file and save it.
 (For very large documents, you will have to be more patient)
